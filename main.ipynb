    "Your tasks:\n",
    "A. Parse & validate\n",
    "   - Parse the JSON safely. If any fields are missing or inconsistent (units, totals, serving count), explicitly note them.\n",
    "   - Do not assume nutrients that are not present on the label. Mark them as “not provided”.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Person context\n",
    "   - Compute BMI = weight / (height/100)^2 and classify (WHO categories). State the numeric BMI and category.\n",
    "   - Only estimate energy needs if sex and activity_level are provided. If not provided, skip TDEE and say “not provided”.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Label math (per serving and per package)\n",
    "   - Confirm serving_size and servings_per_container. If missing, treat “per serving” as the only basis and say container totals are unknown.\n",
    "   - Compute calories from macros using Atwater factors: protein=4 kcal/g, carbs=4 kcal/g, fat=9 kcal/g. Note that label carbs include fiber; do not subtract fiber unless the label explicitly provides available carbs.\n",
    "   - Show grams and, when possible, %DV/%RDA for: calories, protein, total fat (and sat/trans if present), total carbohydrate (sugars, added sugars, fiber), sodium, cholesterol, and any vitamins/minerals listed.\n",
    "   - If %DV is not on the label but the dietary guidelines text provides reference values, compute %DV from those references and cite which values you used. If neither is available, write “%DV: n/a”.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Guidelines alignment\n",
    "   - Use the provided dietary guidelines text as the source of truth. Map each relevant nutrient to the recommended limits/targets.\n",
    "   - Explicitly state where the product is: “Meets”, “Close to limit”, or “Exceeds” guideline thresholds (e.g., high sodium, high added sugar, low fiber, high sat fat). Quote the exact threshold you’re applying from the guidelines text.\n",
    "\n",
    "E. Suitability for the person\n",
    "   - Considering BMI and the guidelines, briefly assess suitability (e.g., “good protein-to-calorie ratio”, “sodium may be high if blood pressure is a concern”).\n",
    "   - If information needed for a strong conclusion is missing (e.g., activity level, health conditions), say what is missing rather than guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "F. Practical recommendations\n",
    "   - Provide 2–4 actionable suggestions: portion control, pairing (e.g., add fiber/protein), frequency of intake, or alternatives that better match the guidelines/person context.\n",
    "\n",
    "G. Transparency & safety\n",
    "   - List any assumptions you made, any missing data, and any rounding.\n",

    "Role: You are a rigorous QA reviewer for nutrition analyses. Your job is to verify the accuracy, completeness, and methodological soundness of the model’s analysis against the provided inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inputs you will receive:\n",
    "- Nutrition label JSON: {response_json}\n",
    "- Dietary guidelines text: {dietary_guidelines_text}\n",
    "- Person parameters:\n",
    "  - Weight: {weight} kg\n",
    "  - Height: {height} cm\n",
    "  - Age: {age} years\n",
    "  (Optional, if present elsewhere in the thread: sex, activity_level, health goals/conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also receive: the model’s analysis to be verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to verify (checklist):\n",
    "1) Parsing & Units\n",
    "   - The JSON was parsed correctly (serving_size, servings_per_container, per-serving nutrients, %DV if present).\n",
    "   - Units are correct and consistent (g vs mg; sodium often in mg; fiber/sugars in g).\n",
    "   - No nutrients were invented; absent fields are labeled “not provided”.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Math & Internal Consistency\n",
    "   - Calories-from-macros (Atwater): protein=4 kcal/g, carbs=4 kcal/g, fat=9 kcal/g. Compare to stated calories.\n",
    "     • If |macro_kcal − label_kcal| > 10% of label_kcal, flag a discrepancy.\n",
    "   - Per-serving vs per-package math is correct (multiplying by servings_per_container when shown).\n",
    "   - %DV calculations (when computed by the model) use reference values present in the label OR explicitly provided in dietary_guidelines_text. No outside defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) BMI (and TDEE logic)\n",
    "   - BMI = weight / (height/100)^2 is computed correctly and WHO category is correct.\n",
    "   - TDEE handling:\n",
    "     • If sex and activity_level are NOT provided, the analysis should NOT fabricate TDEE; it should say “not provided”.\n",
    "     • If TDEE is computed, the method (e.g., Mifflin–St Jeor + activity factor) must be named and the result should be within ±5% of your recomputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Guidelines Alignment\n",
    "   - Each guideline claim (e.g., high sodium, added sugars limit, saturated fat, fiber targets, key vitamins/minerals) is supported by thresholds/targets that appear in {dietary_guidelines_text}.\n",
    "   - When the analysis labels something as Meets/Close/Exceeds, that label matches the product’s numbers vs the stated threshold/target.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Suitability & Recommendations\n",
    "   - Suitability comments are tailored to the person context (at least using BMI and any salient nutrient flags).\n",
    "   - Recommendations are specific, actionable, and flow logically from the analysis (portion control, pairing, swaps, frequency). Avoid generic, unrelated advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Transparency\n",
    "   - Missing data, assumptions, and rounding are disclosed. No medical diagnosis is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Red flags (must downgrade accuracy if present):\n",
    "- Hallucinated nutrient values or thresholds not present in the label or guidelines text.\n",
    "- Using generic %DV/DRI numbers without stating their source when the guidelines text is provided.\n",
    "- Misuse of per 100 g vs per serving.\n",
    "- Major math errors (macro calories, %DV, totals).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring rubric for “Overall accuracy”:\n",
    "- Accurate: No material errors; at most minor omissions/wording issues; math and thresholds correct.\n",
    "- Partially accurate: 1–3 material issues (e.g., %DV miscalc, unclear threshold citation, modest kcal mismatch) but core conclusions mostly stand.\n",
    "- Inaccurate: 4+ material issues, or any critical error (e.g., fabricated TDEE without inputs, major kcal mismatch, invented data).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output format (Markdown only; no extra prose outside the sections below):\n",
    "\n",
    "# Verification Summary\n",
    "- Overall accuracy: [Accurate / Partially accurate / Inaccurate]\n",
    "- Key issues found:\n",
    "  - [List each major inaccuracy/omission succinctly. When relevant, quote 3–12 words from the guidelines you used, e.g., “limit sodium to …”. If none, write “None.”]\n",
    "- Recommendations for improvement:\n",
    "  - [Concrete fixes the model should make: e.g., “Recompute calories from macros,” “Cite sodium threshold line,” “Mark TDEE as ‘not provided’ when sex/activity_level are missing.” If none, write “None.”]\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "- Be concise but thorough; focus on factual accuracy and completeness.\n",
    "- Use clear, objective language.\n",
    "- Do not introduce outside data; verify only against the provided JSON, guidelines text, and person parameters.\n",
    "- If critical inputs are missing, require the analysis to state “not provided” rather than guessing.\n",
